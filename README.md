# Flashcard study thing

This is a simple Next.js project I wrote to help memorize binary and hex numbers for a college class I'm taking this semester, Digital Logic Design.

This also serves as me figuring out reactjs for the first time, so be patient, but I think it turned out pretty good.

### Key takeaways:
- I learned how React.js works (pretty simple to get started at least)
- Discovered Next.js, which is *amazing* and I have since used to fully re-build my personal website, https://isaacclloyd.com
- Also learned Tailwind CSS, which, as someone who barely knew normal CSS, took the most time to figure out, but I love it

View the project and have some fun learning hexadecimal:
